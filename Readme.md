# Senior Capstone: Turtle Tracking Project

## Introduction

The Turtle Tracking Project is a collaboration with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and Texas Instruments (TI). Approximately 30 to 40 Endangered Northwestern Pond Turtles are monitored within an approximate 60 meter by 60 meter habitat. The WDFW needs to locate eggs laid by female turtles and transfer them to zoos for raising. The process of tracking the turtle eggs is laborious and time-consuming, requiring personnel to triangulate the position of Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) tags on each turtle and then collect the eggs. This project seeks to offer a less labor-intensive method of tracking turtles and alerts WDFW when turtles have potentially laid eggs
